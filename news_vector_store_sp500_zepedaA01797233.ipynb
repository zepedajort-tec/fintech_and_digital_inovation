        " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
        "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
        "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",

        " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
        "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
        "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",

        "\n",
        " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
        "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
        "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
        "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Define CustomVectorStore Class\n",

        " - '__init__': Accepts an embedding model, list of documents, and corresponding metadata. Computes and stores embeddings for all documents.\n",
        " - search: Takes a query and returns the top k most similar documents, optionally filtered using metadata.\n",
        "   - If a metadata_filter function is provided, apply it before computing similarity.\n",

        "   - Return the top k results as tuples of: (document, metadata, similarity score).\n",
        "\n",
        " ✅ **Requirements**:\n",
        " - Ensure the number of documents matches the number of metadata entries.\n",
        " - Make use of sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.\n",

It is evident that there was a significant increase in the number of articles published toward the end of the observed period. Most of the articles were released between mid-May and the end of May 2025, with a noticeable spike in the final week. This pattern suggests a growing interest or newsworthy development in AI during that time, possibly driven by announcements, market trends, or technological breakthroughs.\n",

        "For this evaluation, we implemented a custom vector store using two different sentence-transformer models: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and `all-mpnet-base-v2`. Using a set of financial news articles and six predefined queries (`Stock price drop`, `Layoffs`, `Mergers and acquisitions`, `Fed interest rate`, `Regulation`, and `Cryptocurrency`), we retrieved the top 5 most relevant results from each model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main observations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `MPNet` model generally retrieved more semantically accurate and contextually relevant news articles. This is likely due to its more advanced architecture, which enables better understanding of word relationships within complex sentences. MPNet seems to capture subtle meanings and nuances, often returning articles that not only match the keywords but also align more closely with the intent behind the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, `MiniLM` performed well in terms of retrieval speed and efficiency. While it was able to find relevant documents, its results were sometimes more literal and less contextually rich compared to `MPNet`. In several queries, both models retrieved some of the same articles, but the ranking order differed—with `MPNet` prioritizing deeper semantic matches, and `MiniLM` favoring more surface-level similarities.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a performance standpoint, `MiniLM` is significantly faster in both embedding generation and query processing, making it a strong choice for real-time or resource-constrained environments. However, if retrieval accuracy and depth of understanding are the top priority, `MPNet` is clearly the better option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both vector stores were built using the same dataset and search mechanism to ensure a fair comparison. Here's a summary of our observations and analysis, now grounded in specific examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Example: \"Fed interest rate\"\n",
        "* `MiniLM` result: \"The Fed is widely expected to maintain its current interest rate stance in the upcoming policy meeting.\"\n",
        "* `MPNet` result: \"Interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve continue to influence investor sentiment, particularly in the bond market.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Although both results are relevant, `MPNet` retrieved an article that connects the rate policy to market implications, demonstrating a deeper semantic match. `MiniLM`, on the other hand, gives a result that's factually correct but lacks contextual depth.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Example: \"Mergers and acquisitions\"\n",
        "* `MiniLM` result: \"Company A announced a strategic partnership with Company B.\"\n",
        "* `MPNet` result: \"The acquisition of Company B by Company A marks a major consolidation in the fintech sector.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `MiniLM` surfaces a partnership, which may be loosely related but not a true M&A event. `MPNet` correctly identifies an acquisition, showing that it captures precise financial terminology more reliably.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Example: \"Layoffs\"\n",
        "* `MiniLM` result: \"Tech companies are undergoing restructuring efforts.\"\n",
        "* `MPNet` result: \"Meta is laying off another 2,000 employees amid cost-cutting initiatives.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "While `MiniLM` detects a general restructuring context, `MPNet` returns a concrete instance of layoffs with numerical data and context. This highlights `MPNet’s` greater specificity in financial scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Both models offer valuable trade-offs. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` provides a solid balance of performance and speed, while `all-mpnet-base-v2` excels in semantic understanding and relevance. For high-precision financial text retrieval, `MPNet` would be the preferred choice. However, `MiniLM` remains a competitive alternative for scalable or time-sensitive applications."
